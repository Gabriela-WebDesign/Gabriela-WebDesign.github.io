        <h1>Little Swimmer &#127946;</h1>
        <p> Little <strong>Gabby</strong> since she was born was curious of <span style="color :blue">water</span> &#128166;
        <br>As little as she was, she got into the <span style="color :aqua">pool</span>
        <br>Thanks to her <strong>grandpa</strong>, who built the pools for a living
        <br>She had one just outside in her <span style="color :green">yard</span>
        <br>She came back home to Poland and lived her best life
        <br>Swimming was in her veins since her <strong>mom</strong> was a swimmer &#127946;
        <br>She went to school and in second grade she had swim lessons
        <br>Since she was swimming from basically being born she was getting bored
        <br>Her energy was to much to handle at home, so her mom looked for a team to join
        <br>She found one called <em>"Gim 92"</em> and made her join
        <br>She started training for real and competig at meets
        <br>She grew up fast and made it to <b>nationals</b>
        <br>She won one medal, then a second, a third
        <br>Medal after a medal &#127941;
        <br><span style="color :gold">Gold</span> after <span style="color :gold">gold</span>
        <br>The story went on
        <br>She got her chance to represent the country
        <br>Met so many nice people along the way
        <br>Till this day she's embracing all the moments
        <br>And doesn't stop following her dream
        <br>Now she's still swimming, competing and thrilling
        <br><i>She finds her peace in the silence of <span style="color :blue">water</span></i> &#128158;
